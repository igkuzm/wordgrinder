                                Unix version


INTRODUCTION
============

WordGrinder is a simple, Unicode-aware word processor that runs on the
console. It's designed to get the hell out of your way and let you write;
it does very little, but what it does it does well.

It supports basic paragraph styles, basic character styles, basic screen
markup, a menu interface that means you don't have to remember complex
key sequences, HTML import and export, and some other useful features.

WordGrinder does not require X. It runs in a terminal. (But there's a
version which uses X if you want it.)



INSTALLATION
============

WordGrinder needs the following packages installed:

 - ninja, the build tool. This is available from:
     https://ninja-build.org/

 - ncursesw, the wide-character version of curses. This is supplied with
   most systems.

 - an X development kit including Xft (if you want the X frontend). This
   is supplied with most systems.

 - zlib. You will already have this, but just on the offchance, it's here:
     http://www.zlib.net/

 - Optionally: Lua, the programming language. WordGrinder has its own built-
   in copy, but if you want to use the system Lua, install it and edit the
   Makefile. Lua is available from:
     http://www.lua.org/

 - a terminal emulator that supports UTF-8. gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm
   and rxvt-unicode do. rxvt and the Linux console don't (unless you use
   jfbterm). You will also need a decent set of Unicode fonts or WordGrinder
   will look funny.

Chances are you already have these in your distribution. Merely install these
packages:

  If you have Debian/Ubuntu:
    ninja-build libncursesw5-dev liblua5.2-dev zlib1g-dev libxft-dev

  If you have Fedora:
    lua lua-devel lua-libs lua-filesystem zlib-devel libXft-devel ncurses ncurses-devel ninja-build

  If you have OSX with Homebrew (ncurses only, sorry):
    ninja pkg-config

To build, simply do:

    make

To install, do:

    sudo make install PREFIX=/usr

(Change PREFIX to whatever you like; naturally, if you're not installing in a
global location, you don't need sudo.)

(There are various other configuration options in the Makefile.)

It is now ready to use.

Special note for compilation on Windows: do 'make windows' with the Mingw64
toolchain and nsis installed. You can either cross-compile from Linux, or
use Cygwin. You'll end up with the installer package in bin/. Yes, if you
prefer the ncurses version will compile natively for Cygwin.

REVISION HISTORY
================

WordGrinder 0.8: 2020-10-13: started out as a bugfix release but then I got
carried away. New features: a paragraph style for numbered bulletpoints; more
look-and-feel options; the caret now flashes; basic template support; word
count display of selected text; custom autosave directory; autocompletion in
file dialogues; Windows console version; recent documents list; Markdown
import. Bugfixes: lots of import and export fixes (and tests so that they stay
fixed); spellchecker fixes; selection position fixes; keyboard entry fixes on
Windows; graphics fixes on Windows; filesystem fixes on Windows; assorted other
minor tweaks.

WordGrinder 0.7.2: 2018-11-29: bugfix release. Pasting immediately after
loading a document no longer hard crashes. Don't buffer overrun if given
invalid unicode. Global settings are now updated correctly (in several
places). Fix a data loss situation when saving fails.

WordGrinder 0.7.1: 2017-11-02: correct and cleaner license reporting;
rearrange the source so that we can avoid shipping upstream dependencies
if we want. No actual code changes.

WordGrinder 0.7: 2017-10-30: new plain text diffable file format; Lua 5.3
support; better locale detection; dense paragraphs mode; lots of bugfixes.
Official OSX support. New (better, hopefully) build system.

WordGrinder 0.6: 2015-04-18: New X11 frontend (actual bold and italic on
Linux machines!); shift+cursor keys starts a selection; more HTML emission
fixes; non-document persistent settings; global key maps (currently via a
configurationfile); search works properly across words with markup; italic
display in a terminal (if you have a new enough version of ncurses); more
traditional charstyle selection (you can press ^B at the beginning of words
now!); more traditional selection model (shift+cursor keys works now!); fix
crash on loading very large .wg files; smart quote support; more efficient
files; undo and redo; spellchecker; colour configuration on X11 and Windows;
MarkDown export.

WordGrinder 0.4: 2013-03-24: Major overhaul: OpenDocument import/export,
new much smaller file format, a proper Windows port, updated to Lua 5.2,
switched away from Prime Mover to make (sob), much bug fixage.

WordGrinder 0.3.3: 2009-12-13: Fixed a bug when searching for or replacing
strings containing multiple whitespace characters (that was triggering the
crash handler). Thanks to lostnbronx for the report. Added RAW and PRE
paragraph styles. Cleaned up HTML import. Add customisability to HTML export.
Relicensed to MIT.

WordGrinder 0.3.2: 2008-11-03: Fixed a very simple and very stupid typo that
caused a crash if you tried to turn autosave on. Added a simple exception
handler to try and prevent data loss on error in the future.

WordGrinder 0.3.1: 2008-09-08: Minor bugfix revision to correct a few minor
but really embarrassing crashes problems in 0.3: no crash on HTML import, no

work.

dialogue.
